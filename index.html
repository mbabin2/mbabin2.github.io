								I am a PhD candidate and lecturer in Western University's department of Computer Science.
								My research focuses on novel applications of procedural content generation (PCG) for video game level generation,
								security, and design. I am the instructor for CS4482: Intro to Game Programming.
								I have been building games and virtual environments professionally over the past 5 years. I am now looking for industry positions as I prepare to graduate in May 2025.

								<strong>BOLT-OUT (2017):</strong> My first full game project was developed as my final submission for CS4482—the very course I now teach.
								Built in Unity, it serves as a tribute to one of my all-time favorite games, <em>F-ZERO GX</em>. While video games have been a lifelong passion of mine, the process of creating <em>BOLT-OUT</em> solidified my decision to pursue a career in game development.
								Below, you’ll find a selection of both my research and development experience.

											My master's thesis focused on the procedural generation of dungeon environments, combining multiple AI techniques,
											including artificial neural networks and N-Gram models, as well as constructive algorithms and
											context-free grammars. This hybrid approach enables the generator to create millions of unique layouts
											and over 5,400 distinct puzzles, all generated in real time with guaranteed solvability.

											My solo entry for LoJam 2024, <em>
												Swarmancer: Path of Bones
											</em>
											is an action roguelike where players control a swarm of rats to defeat enemies.
											Unlike my previous solo hackathon project, I focused on experimenting with AI technologies rather than creating
											all assets myself. The main challenge was optimizing pathfinding for thousands of entities. I solved this by using
											flow fields for swarm navigation while enemies relied on a more refined navmesh. This project won the Judges' Award for
											Best Gameplay.

										Published at FDG 2025, this work explores training an AI agent to balance games by generating new content.
										Using Pokémon as a case study, we focused on the complex interactions between type, stats, and movesets in turn-based battles.
										Our agent successfully generated new Pokémon capable of balancing a restricted pool from the original 151.
										A crucial component of this work was a dense numerical embedding that not only encoded stats and types but also battle dynamics.
										The framework used for generation is provided above.

										My latest work, submitted to IEEE GEM, explores improving the performance of the WFC algorithm by

										My approach involved using the marching squares algorithm for both input and output representation,
										alongside ML-based function approximation to iteratively generate each of the algorithm's constraint satisfaction step.
										These optimizations resulted in a 5× speed increase over the original algorithm.

										<strong>
											Enhancing Player Interactions with LLM Driven NPCs (Ongoing)
										</strong>
									</h3>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<p>
										I am currently supervising multiple undergraduate thesis projects in Computer Science and Software Engineering.
										One CS thesis project is exploring how to improve NPC dialogue interactions by using Large Language Models (LLMs) in a closed system.
										Traditional LLM-driven NPCs often allow unrestricted input, leading to immersion-breaking responses.
										This research proposes having the LLM generate player prompts, ensuring all interactions remain consistent with the game’s setting.
										Additional work investigates NPC memory storage, retrieval, and the maintenance of social structures to inform NPC behavior and dialogue.
